# STRINGS LAB
1.	You have been tasked with creating a python program that would allow you to get input from a user (string) and iterate through the list with the condition being controlled by the len function to set the limit of the loop and prevent an IndexError. (Did this in class today)

2.	You have been tasked with creating a function that would have 3 arguments (firstname, lastname, idnumber). Using indexing slicing, get the first 3 letters of the firstname, 3 letters of the lastname, and the 3 characters of the idnumber and concatenate them to make a login name. (Did this in class)


3.	Create a string called, “Hey guys it’s lab time and Daniel is missing in class” and assign it to the variable lab. You have been tasked with creating an input statement that will allow a user to enter a string and have the python code that will check if a string is in a string or not.
